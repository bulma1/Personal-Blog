Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in modern cloud-native applications. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of Kubernetes and learn how to deploy your first application.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Key Kubernetes Concepts

### 1. Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or more containers that share storage and network resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

### 2. Deployments
Deployments manage the desired state for pods and replica sets. They provide declarative updates and rollbacks.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
```

### 3. Services
Services provide stable network endpoints for pods. They enable load balancing and service discovery.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Getting Started

1. Install kubectl:
```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

2. Install Minikube for local development:
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

3. Start Minikube:
```bash
minikube start
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Always specify resource requests and limits
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Use horizontal pod autoscaling

2. **Security**
   - Use network policies
   - Implement RBAC
   - Scan container images
   - Use secrets for sensitive data

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana
   - Monitor cluster health
   - Set up alerts

## Conclusion

Kubernetes provides a powerful platform for managing containerized applications. While it has a steep learning curve, understanding these basic concepts will help you get started with container orchestration.

Remember to:
- Start small and gradually scale
- Use declarative configurations
- Implement proper monitoring
- Follow security best practices
